      <h2 class="cap">Our Approach
        <p>“Measuring success in recovery only by how many consecutive days someone is sober is like measuring diabetes treatment outcomes by the last time someone had a doughnut”. </p>
        <p>We aren’t tackling a side effect. We are helping the whole person, one small step, tool, or nudge at a time.</p>
        <p>The Emerge app by Crow & Pitcher utilizes daily activity to identify inflection points for 'nudges'–where you are plateauing, escalating in use, or staying on track.</p>
        <p>Emerge provides insights that help steer you back on your personalized path to a better quality of life—with suggested interventions such as new coping strategies or partnered tools towards recovery, from evidence-based clinical guidance.</p>
